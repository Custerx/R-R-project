### webpack.config.js

## Container / Presentational principle
The Container / Presentational principle is a pattern for React components. The container component is the one that carries all the logic: functions for handling state changes, internal component state and so on.

In contrast a presentational component is merely used for displaying the intended markup. Presentational components are plain JavaScript functions receiving data from the container component as props.
